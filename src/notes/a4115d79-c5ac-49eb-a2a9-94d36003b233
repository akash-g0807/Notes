#+title: Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning algorithms learn from an *input* X to a given *output* Y. i.e. using mappings

\begin{equation*}
X \rightarrow Y
\end{equation*}

The key concept is:

#+begin_quote
You give your model examples to learn from where the right answer is given (the correct output Y)

** Examples of Supervised Learning
1. Spam Filtering:
   + Input (X): Email
   + Output (Y): Whether it is spam or not
2. Speech Recognition:
   + Input (X): Audio
   + Output(Y): Text Transcript

Of course there are more examples

* Types of Supervised Learning
There are two main types of supervised learning
